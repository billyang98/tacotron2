david_data_dir/audio_1_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-01-10.wav|but then the idea formed in my mind 
david_data_dir/audio_1_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-01-04.wav|usually my purpose has been to make a film about some corner of that infinitely varied world 
david_data_dir/audio_1_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-01-05.wav|so I have had the luck to find them film rare creatures that few outsiders have seen in the wild and to gaze on some of the most marvellous spectacles that the wild places of the world have to offer 
david_data_dir/audio_1_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-01-11.wav|that a group of us might make a series of films that portrayed animals in a slightly different way 
david_data_dir/audio_1_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-01-39.wav|some discoveries have been truly sensational 
david_data_dir/audio_1_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-01-07.wav|giant lemurs leaping through the forests of Madagascar. the biggest lizards in the world prowling like dragons through the jungle of a tiny island in Indonesia 
david_data_dir/audio_1_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-01-13.wav|we will try to survey the whole Animal Kingdom and consider each great group of animals in the light of the part it has played in the long drama of life from its beginnings until today 
david_data_dir/audio_1_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-01-12.wav|our subject would not be only natural history in the sense that those two words are normally used but the history of nature 
david_data_dir/audio_1_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-01-06.wav|a tree full of displaying birds of paradise in New Guinea 
david_data_dir/audio_1_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-01-02.wav|it was a revelation of the splendor and fecundity of the natural world from which I have never recovered 
david_data_dir/audio_1_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-01-16.wav|and a description of the group of animals containing tens of thousands of species within one chapter compels vast omissions 
david_data_dir/audio_1_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-01-17.wav|my method was to try to perceive the single most significant thread in the history of a group 
david_data_dir/audio_1_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-01-03.wav|since then I've managed one way or another to get back to the tropics many times
