david_data_dir/audio_1_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-01-37.wav|since this book was first written science of course has continued to make new discoveries that have illuminated and amplified the history of nature 
david_data_dir/audio_2_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-02-56.wav|by doing so he replaced a philosophical speculation 
david_data_dir/audio_2_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-02-538.wav|and from them 
david_data_dir/audio_2_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-02-213.wav|first it can act as a blueprint for the manufacture of amino acids and second it has the ability to replicate itself 
david_data_dir/audio_2_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-02-413.wav|so that it's broken down into separate cells 
david_data_dir/audio_2_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-02-346.wav|packets of chlorophyll which light blue greens use the energy of sunlight to assemble complex molecules as food for the cell 
david_data_dir/audio_2_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-02-222.wav|each then acts as a template to which other simpler molecules become attached until each has once more become a double helix

david_data_dir/audio_2_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-02-320.wav|and the groups of them standing on the sun dabbled seafloor are as close as we may ever get 
david_data_dir/audio_2_20db_600ms_200lp/stripped_audio/sound-02-242.wav|we can use DNA sequences to estimate when two species split apart
